#WSO2 Developer Studio Kernel
=====================

WSO2 Developer Studio Kernel provides a set of common plugins which can be used to develop Eclipse plugins for the WSO2 products which are based on award wining WSO2 carbon platform.

After a major architecture revamping with version 4.0.0, WSO2 Developer Studio is moved in to a kernel based model. All the product specific plugins will use the Developer Studio Kernel as the base for their implementation.
